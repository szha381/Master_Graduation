This project provides a LaTeX document class: ``seuthesix''
for typesetting thesis of Southeast University, Nanjing, China.
This package provides three important files:
1. `seuthesix.cls'.
2. `seuthesix.cfg', this is the configuration file of seuthesix and
will be loaded by `seuthesix.cls' at runtime. This file must be in the same directory as
`seuthesix.cls'.
3. `seuthesix.bst', this is the accompanying bibliography style file
for `seuthesix.cls'.
